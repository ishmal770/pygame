All of my commits are in the master branch!

I created this fun little game with beach vibes and a summertime theme to take my mind off the fact that I don't have any vacation plans! It's called BeachBlitz; in the game, you move around a crab and collect beach balls while avoiding cages. I started developing this game using Pygame, an easy game development library for Python. Since I am most familiar with Python, this was a great choice for me!











I initially struggled with character animation and establishing the game's aesthetic since Pygame isn't designed for visuals like HTML and CSS. I had to take time to learn the language, testing and exploring each function in the library along the way. One thing different from game development, is that you not only have to focus on a finished polished product, but the game being enjoyable by other people. That was something I wasn't used to.












My main challenge was turning my game into a website; I wanted it to be easily accessible for everyone. I had to install PyInstaller to convert it into a web app, but I encountered a lot of problems. My game wasn't even loading and displayed a black screen. Due to my struggles, I decided that I could make my game downloadable for others to enjoy instead of a website. Initially, I didn't know how to compress all my folders and turn my file into an executable (.exe), but after some research, I found the information I needed and was able to make it downloadable. 


This experience was awesome! I think it's cool to explore many other perspectives of coding
